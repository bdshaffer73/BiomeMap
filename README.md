BiomeMap is a Spigot Minecraft server plugin for generating .PNG images of the biomes of a map. 

To configure the plugin, edit mapconfig.yml in $SERVER_PATH/plugins/BiomeMap.
To use the plugin, run "map-biomes <WORLD_NAME>" from the command line of the server. If you don't know the world name,
leave that out and it will give you a list of all the worlds and their names on the server.

If run successfully, a <WORLD_NAME>.png file will be generated in $SERVER_PATH/plugins/BiomeMap with a color coded map of that world's biomes!
